  <h1> Hey World! This is my first webpage ever! :D <h1>

  <p> My name is Nyasiah, call me Ny XD. I'm a small, nerdy, fangirl with heart of a child! :D I'm big on cartoons! I love Disney, I love old cartoons (Like from the 1950s to 2007, some of the new cartoons are either okay or just plain trash), I love anime, I love mangas and comics and so much more! </p>

 <p> First off, I'm a big math and science nerd. I love anything related to these two subjects because when they are used together, almost anything can be created and I am who loves creativity! </p>
    
  <p> I'm also a writer in disguise. I write about lots of things. My favorite genres are sci-fi, realistic fiction, fan ficition, fantasy and horror. I write in a form of a narrative, but I really like writing in a form of a screenplay as well! I have a website up, but it's currently going through a major redesign, so please be patient!</p>
